//! Per-target call-surface definitions for the binding IR.
//!
//! A binding contract is parameterized by a [`Surface`]: the concrete
//! target whose ABI the contract describes. Each surface picks its own
//! shape for the four target-divergent concepts the IR carries:
//!
//! - the protocol foreign code uses to install and dispatch a callback
//!   trait,
//! - the layout of an encoded buffer across native call slots,
//! - the carrier that names the integer or struct used for an opaque
//!   handle,
//! - the protocol used to drive an asynchronous callable to completion.
//!
//! The trait associates each of these to one concrete type per surface;
//! everything in [`crate::ir`] that names a target-divergent concept
//! reads it through `S: Surface`. A `Bindings<Native>` cannot pass for a
//! `Bindings<Wasm32>`, and a Swift backend typed against
//! `Bindings<Native>` cannot accidentally receive a wasm contract.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use boltffi_binding::{Bindings, Native, Wasm32};
//!
//! fn render_native(bindings: &Bindings<Native>) { /* ... */ }
//! fn render_wasm  (bindings: &Bindings<Wasm32>) { /* ... */ }
//! ```
