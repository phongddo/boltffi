//! Per-surface lowering decisions.
//!
//! The IR's [`Surface`] trait defines what each target's
//! divergent shapes *are* — `BufferShape`, `HandleCarrier`,
//! `AsyncProtocol`, `CallbackProtocol`. It does not say which value to
//! pick at a given call site. The lowering pass needs that pick: a
//! string parameter on Wasm32 must cross as `Slice`, a record returned
//! by value on Wasm32 must cross as `Packed`, and so on. Those rules
//! used to live in `boltffi_ffi_rules`; with that crate retired, the
//! rules live here.
//!
//! [`SurfaceLower`] adds those decisions to a [`Surface`] without
//! touching the IR. It is sealed: only [`Native`] and [`Wasm32`] can
//! implement it. The public lowering function carries the
//! `S: SurfaceLower` bound so external callers cannot supply a surface
//! the lowering pass has not been taught about.
//!
//! [`Surface`]: crate::Surface
//! [`Native`]: crate::Native
//! [`Wasm32`]: crate::Wasm32
