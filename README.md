## Why BoltFFI?

Serialization-based FFI is slow. UniFFI serializes every value to a byte buffer. wasm-bindgen materializes every struct as a JavaScript object. That overhead shows up even when you're making tens or hundreds of FFI calls per second.

BoltFFI uses zero-copy where possible. Primitives pass as raw values. Structs with primitive fields pass as pointers to memory both sides can read directly. WASM uses a wire buffer format that avoids per-field allocation. Only strings and collections go through encoding.

## What it does

Mark your Rust types with `#[data]` and functions with `#[export]`:

```rust
use boltffi::*;

#[data]
pub struct Point {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
}

#[export]
pub fn distance(a: Point, b: Point) -> f64 {
    let dx = b.x - a.x;
    let dy = b.y - a.y;
    (dx * dx + dy * dy).sqrt()
}
```

Run `boltffi pack`:

```bash
boltffi pack apple
# Produces: ./dist/apple/YourCrate.xcframework + Package.swift

boltffi pack android
# Produces: ./dist/android/jniLibs/<abi>/libyour_crate.so + Kotlin bindings

boltffi pack wasm
# Produces: ./dist/wasm/pkg/*.wasm + TypeScript bindings + npm package
```

Android ABI selection is configurable in `boltffi.toml`:

```toml
[targets.android]
architectures = ["arm64"]
```

Apple slice selection is configurable too:

```toml
[targets.apple]
ios_architectures = ["arm64"]
simulator_architectures = ["arm64"]
include_macos = true
macos_architectures = ["arm64"]
```

Any Apple architecture list can be set to `[]` to exclude that slice family. For example, set
`ios_architectures = []` when you want simulator-only Apple packaging from a config overlay. BoltFFI
still requires at least one Apple slice overall.

When `architectures` is omitted, BoltFFI keeps the existing default Android matrix:
`arm64`, `armv7`, `x86_64`, and `x86`. `boltffi pack android --no-build` now validates that each
configured ABI already has a built Rust static library and ignores stale artifacts for
unconfigured ABIs.

You can also apply per-invocation overlays without mutating the tracked base config.
BoltFFI still requires a base `boltffi.toml`, then merges the overlay on top for that one command:

```bash
boltffi --overlay boltffi.ci.toml pack android
boltffi --overlay boltffi.release.toml pack all --release
```

This is useful for CI, release builds, or machine-local overrides. `boltffi init` does not accept
`--overlay`.

Use it from Swift, Kotlin, or TypeScript:

```swift
let d = distance(a: Point(x: 0, y: 0), b: Point(x: 3, y: 4)) // 5.0
```

```kotlin
val d = distance(a = Point(x = 0.0, y = 0.0), b = Point(x = 3.0, y = 4.0)) // 5.0
```

```typescript
import { distance } from 'your-crate';
const d = distance({ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 3, y: 4 }); // 5.0
```

The generated bindings use each language's idioms. Swift gets async/await. Kotlin gets coroutines. TypeScript gets Promises. Errors become native exceptions.
